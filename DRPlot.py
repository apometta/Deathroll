"""This file, written by Andrew H. Pometta, is the main file for the Deathroll 
project this file is apart of.  It uses both DRSimulate.py and 
DeathrollCalc.py to get data on the winrates and average roll counts in 
Deathroll games of different starting conditions, as a guide for players that 
wish to know the expected results of a Deathroll.  It uses this data to 
generate graphs, to be used in a larger report."""
