"""This file, written by Andrew H. Pometta is the file for calculating and
exporting the probability that the first player is going to win a game of
Deathrolling given a starting roll of an n-sided die.  As opposed to
DeathrollSim.py and DRSimulate.py, this file does not actualy simulate a game
of deathrolling - rather, it mathematically calculates the exact probability
(or as close to the exact as your computer, OS and Python 3 can get).

The details of deriving the math formulas will be relegated to another
document.  Since our solution involves dynamic programming, we will
continually keep track of a summation as our calculations progress.

For finding the expected number of rolls per game, a nearly identical
approach is used, but a small difference in the formula.
