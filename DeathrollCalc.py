"""This file, written by Andrew H. Pometta is the file for calculating and
exporting the probability that the first player is going to win a game of
Deathrolling given a starting roll of an n-sided die.  As opposed to
DeathrollSim.py and DRSimulate.py, this file does not actualy simulate a game
of deathrolling - rather, it mathematically calculates the exact probability
(or as close to the exact as your computer, OS and Python 3 can get).

The details of deriving the math formula will be relegated to another
document.  The math formula requires the use of dynamic programming, so
the exported data will necessarily be a range of data, containing the
probability of the first player winning for all n in the range [1, N] where
N is the user's inputted maximum n.

For reference, the formula for all positive integer n > 1 is:

P(n) = c_n(n/[(n^2)-1]) where P(1) = 1 and
c(n) = 1 + sum[i=2 to n-1](1/i(sigma[j=2 to i](P(j)))) +
      1/n(sigma[j=2 to n-1](P(j)))
Alternatively, c can be defined recursively as such:
c(n) = c(n-1) + (1/(n-1))sigma[j=2 to n-1](P(j)) + (1/n)P(n-1) where c(2) = 1


Sorry if my notation sucks.

The strategy to calculate the values effeciently quite obviously utilizes
dynamic programming, seeing as P(n) is a recursive piecewise function, to
which P(k) for any k requires knowledge of all P(l) for l in [1, k-1].  We
use one list to keep track of the running data for P(n) for quick reference,
and another few variables to keep track of c(n) as n progresses.
